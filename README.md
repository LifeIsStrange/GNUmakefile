# GNUmakefile

This aim of this project is to enjoy the power of plain [GNU Makefile](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/).
It is a personal attempt to satisfy every needs when compiling a project.

This project is intended to better understand the limits of [GNU Makefile](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) and the needs to have tools like [CMake](https://www.cmake.org/) or [GNU autotools](https://www.gnu.org/software/automake/).

The goal is to write GNUmakefile file for any project with the tools provided.


## List of needs

This is a list of features that the project have to do:

- [ ] Use CLI variables (`make CC="gcc"`)
- [ ] Use built-in rules to compile
- [ ] Track dependencies to header files
- [ ] Every generated file have to be in a separate folder
- [ ] Detect missing folders and creating them
- [ ] Object instrumentation is preserved (`make CFLAGS="-g"`)
- [ ] Build static libraries / shared libraries based on binaryâ€™s name
- [ ] Any librairies dependencies is automatically detected to must be up-to-date
- [ ] Parallel execution is preserved (`make -j JOBS`)
- [ ] Do not use shell, nor wildcard
- [ ] Better printing (without colors)


This is a list of features in a developer-side that the project have to do:

- [ ] It must be simple to write
- [ ] Units tests must be easy to implemement
- [ ] Custom rules (like `make docs` for generate documentation)


The utopic goal:

- [ ] Modular project: Each functionnality can be added as wish
